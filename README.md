#### Client
- Goodreads My Bookshelf   
About: Goodreads is an Amazon owned, social oriented, book site. It's features include adding books you've read, want to read, or are reading to your bookshelf, participating in reading challenges, sharing your likes and dislikes with your friends, and reviewing books.

#### Problem
- Goodread's My Bookshelf feature is poorly designed. The colorscheme and visual impression is boring, ugly, hard to navigate, old fashioned, and in general not user friendly.
- The interface is especially complicated for users who are not incredibly tech savvy with experience hunting down features (ie. older users), or those who are impatient (me).
- Speaking as a user personally, I created an account years ago and never added books to my list or continued use because the interface was so unweildy. As a voracious reader, this is a product I would use frequently, however have not at all.

#### Objective
- Redesign the My Bookshelf feature to imrpove visual impact, ease of use, navigation, and access to options.
- This should result in higher user retention rates, and higher use by account holders.

#### Target Audience
- Anyone who reads frequently on their own.
- Book clubs.
- Social media users.

#### Goals
- Re-design flow of navigation around Goodreads My Bookshelf.
- Update fonts and color scheme as well as graphics and animations.
- Make website mobile responsive.
- Improve social media integration.
- Remove duplicate search bars.
- Clean up "Tools" - hide as these are not common use options.
- Clean up Bookshelf nav (across top of book list) as this isn't intuitive or common use.

#### Projected Timeline
- Discovery: 11/7 - 11/8
- Prototyping: 11/9 - 11/15
- Development: 11/15 - 11/121
