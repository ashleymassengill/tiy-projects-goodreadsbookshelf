### Reference websites:
[Readernaut](http://readernaut.com/ashisms/following/)  this is the cleanest and simplest design visually, although some navigation is redundant and illogical  
[iBooks](http://www.apple.com/ibooks/) App only, but design is spot on as far as easy navigation of the bookshelf itsself.  Shows the book cover, if the book is new/unread, easy to group books into categories, logical default sort settings.  Not social tied, and doesn't show as much info such as rating etc.  
[Barnes & Noble](https://www.barnesandnoble.com/)  Bookseller website, but they do very well showing a quick glance at the book cover, title, author, and average user star rating at a quick clean glance.
